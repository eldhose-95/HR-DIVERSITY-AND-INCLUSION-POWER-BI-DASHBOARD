# HR-DIVERSITY-AND-INCLUSION-POWER-BI-DASHBOARD

### The dashboard was aimed at helping the hiring team assess the progress of the organization with respect to diversity and inclusion. It reflects relevant KPIs in hiring, promotion, and turnover

Analysis Procedure:

1) Connecting to Data sources, transforming data in the Power Query editor and finally loading the transformed data.
   
2) using Dax functions like calculate, Sum, Average, and Count rows for further analysis.
  
3) Use of visuals like column charts, stacked bar charts, doughnut charts, Cards, maps, funnel charts, and tree maps.
   
4) I have also used some advanced visual features like page navigation buttons, Cards(new ones), slicers, and many more.
